# Optimized TSP

The idea of this algorithm is to assume that running TSP on all houses and starting location gives the correct order of dropping off TAs. Now given a TSP traversal of the graph, we will try to optimize the cost by choosing better dropoff locations for each TA. More specifically, for every TA, we will consider all points as potential dropoff locations and determine the one with minimum cost of driving and walking. This algorithm will run N times because if the dropoff of the last TA changes in the first pass of the TAs, it can potentially take N-1 iterations before the change reaches the first dropped off TA.
