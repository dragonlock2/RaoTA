# Minor Improvement Alg

Note: Only run this when a solution for all inputs has been found.

This algorithm takes in a solution and identifies parts that can be easily improved and does them. It identifies groups of TAs that follow the same edge home and runs brute force to figure out a more optimal dropoff ordering.

Work in Progress: Use TSP to optimize dropoff cycle given new dropoffs
