# Brute C++ LVIII

Updated implementation of brutepython in C++. Using bit packing and other optimizations, obtained a rough 100x speed increase over brutepython. Currently limited to size 58 inputs but framework is setup to remove this limitation. Still, only up to size 32 inputs run in reasonable time.
